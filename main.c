      //a) the cube is some number of rotations away on the front face, in which case this the first and second examples prove that it works
      //b) the cube is some number of rotations away on a different face, in which case the third example demostrates that this works
      //c) the cube is not 1 move away, and so should be rotated again. this is proven by the 4th one, which is two different moves away from a solve.
