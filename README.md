# Rubik's Cube Project
Originally done as a final project for my Data Structures class, with the primary focus on creating something that could theoretically work. Focus currently is on optimizing the data structure used to represent the cube's state, although I eventually would like to program it to solve a cube.

# Data Structure Description:


# TO-DO:
 - Add visualization gui for the solution/exploration process
 - Refactor solver to use hash table instead of array
 - Change solver to use an algorithm instead of just brute force breadth-first search
 - refactor print_Cube to be intuitive and easy to understand
 - clean up comments (sheesh, so many!)
